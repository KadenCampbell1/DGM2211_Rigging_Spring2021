I wish the top leg control was rotated 90 degrees so when the leg was moved forward and backward it wouldn't move the control out of the side view.
The colors of the controls are a little hard to see and differanciate.
Gimble lock is very easy to achieve with the shoulder joints

I like how quick and responsive the rig is.
I like how clean the controls look. What I mean is there are not many cluddering up the model and they are where the joints bend.

I am referencing the walk cycle from page 108.
