The hand controls are too small
I wish the elbow controls moved with the hand control.
The arms are harder to swing in nice arcs as compared to FK

I love how the feet stay where they are when I move the body.
I enjoy how fast animating with IK is.
I like how the knee control moves with the foot control.


I am referencing the walk cycle from page 108.
